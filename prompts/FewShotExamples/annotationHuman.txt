The following dummy function is an example and not part of our program.
This is the function/method dummy. Using the list of approximation techniques and any other not listed, identify all the areas of the code where you think approximation techniques can be applied. Mark these areas of code with a "/* @Approximation possibility [No.n] [description] */" (it is not necessary an area of code like this existed in this function). If there is variable such that when its value is increased or decreased, results in decrease of instruction/clock cycles mark it with a "// $Knob Variable" before its initialization. You can also create your own knob variables.

int dummy(int array[],int array_size) {
    // Calculate the sum of the array
    for (int i = 0; i < array_size; i++) {
        sum += array[i];
    }

    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
    return sum;
}

Respond in the correct JSON format. The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"annotated_code": {"title": "Annotated Code", "description": "Annotated code with comments where approximation can occur, code should be formated as corrently with '\n' and other spacings.", "type": "string"}, "description": {"title": "description", "description": "Describe each approximation identifyied", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["annotated_code", "description"]}
```
