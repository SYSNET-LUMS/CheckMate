Before we begin the process above, let us first identify which functions should be approximated. For all functions in the code, please reply in this format:

# List of functions
{{
  "function_1": "approximate",
  "function_2": "do not approximate",
  ...
  (all functions in code)
}}

# Reasoning


A point to note, the end_simulation function is not to be approximated under any circumstance.

Here is the codebase:
